The Python Operator Framework provides a simple, lightweight, and powerful way of writing Juju charms, the best way to encapsulate operational experience in code.

This repo is the application for the [pythonoperatorframework.io](https://pythonoperatorframework.io/) website.

The site is largely maintained by the [Web and Design team](https://ubuntu.com/blog/topics/design) at [Canonical](https://www.canonical.com). It is a stateless website project based on [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and hosted on a [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) cluster.
